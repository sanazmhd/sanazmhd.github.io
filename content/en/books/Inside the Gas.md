Shlomo Veneziaâ€™s story is one of survival and unimaginable hardship. Born into a poor Jewish-Italian community, his early life was relatively safe under the protection of the Italians, but everything changed when the Germans invaded and deported his family to Auschwitz. Tragically, his mother and sisters were killed upon arrival, likely in the gas chambers.

Faced with the harsh reality of survival, Venezia agreed to become a Sonderkommando, a role that involved performing some of the most grotesque and dehumanizing tasks imaginable: removing the bodies from the gas chambers and burning them in the crematoria. Despite the trauma, he shares his experiences with remarkable clarity, recounting the daily grind of this brutal existence and the terrifying presence of Otto Moll, the so-called Angel of Death, who oversaw the crematoria. Venezia also narrates the failed escape attempts of some prisoners and the revolt in October 1944.

What makes Veneziaâ€™s testimony unique is that he was one of the few survivors who was in direct contact with the machinery of death in Auschwitz and lived to tell the tale. Most victims of the gas chambers never had the chance to speak out, but Veneziaâ€™s survival allowed him to share the horrors that took place there. However, he knew that as a Sonderkommando, he was likely marked for death by the SS. Yet, he survived and bravely became a witness to these unspeakable atrocities, ensuring that future generations would hear about the unimaginable suffering of those in the death camps.#books
